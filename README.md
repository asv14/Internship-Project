# Internship-Project
Developed a real time embedded AI system combining OCR(Optical Character Recognition) and TTS(Text-To-Speech) to assist visually impaired users. Utilized PaddleOCR for robust text detection and recognition and integrated it with a VITTS-based offline TTS engine to convert recognised text into natural-sounding speech. Implemented multithreaded pipelines, GPIO-based mode selection, and latency optimizations to ensure smooth operation on Raspberry Pi CM5 with Bliaze X600M accelerator. Enabled seamless OCR-to-Speech conversion for dynamic environments without reliance on internet connectivity, showcasing effective integration of Vision and Audio systems for accessibility-focused use case.
